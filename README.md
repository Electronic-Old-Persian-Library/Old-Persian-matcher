This project leverages Optical Character Recognition (OCR) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) technologies to read and match the texts. Specifically, I use OCR to convert the cuneiform signs from images into machine-readable text. Then I will use [Prof Enrique Jiménez’s](https://www.assyriologie.uni-muenchen.de/personen/professoren/jimenez/index.html) project to apply [algorithms](https://github.com/ElectronicBabylonianLiterature/ngram-matcher) to detect and match segments of different tablets or inscriptions, aiding in the reconstruction of fragmented texts.

For more the details, please check my new article on [Medium](https://levelup.gitconnected.com/the-electronic-babylonian-library-ebl-gilgamesh-project-f883e0ff068f) and [eBL documentation](https://github.com/ElectronicBabylonianLiterature/generic-documentation).
